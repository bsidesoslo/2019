  bio: |
    David Lodge is a grumpy Yorkshireman who has been doing this sort of stuff for too long. Pen tester by day, pretender at hardware by night; likes taking stuff apart, but is unable to get it back together afterwards. He's only doing this because he's never been to Oslo and to try and get a free ticket and is secretly hoping that no-one will be present at the talk.

The rise of cheap, low powered communication technology has been most prominent in the fields of locks, where the traditional model of a key, rfid reader or magnetic stripe does not work for many use cases.

This talk will be demonstrating how many smart locks fail to fully think out security and in many ways make the smart locks weaker than its low-tech equivalent.

And yes, some of these methods will be destructive, as much as can be done in an unventilated room at least.

I will be going through several smart locks, all designed for convenience and showing where the security flaws are and the different vectors to attack. 

This will include attacks on:
* BLE
* magnets
* screwdrivers
* hitting it with a hammer
* blowtorches
* bolt cutters. 

I will be bringing some padlocks for audience members to have a go at bolt cutterering themselves to see how weak most padlocks actually are.

Some locks will be focused on, specifically the Nokelock series of products, the slok lock and ultraloq. Including demostration of how the protocols were reversed and how they can be used to unlock a padlock from a python script or Android device.
