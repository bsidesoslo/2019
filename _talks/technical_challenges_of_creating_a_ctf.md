There are many technical challenges when creating a CTF. Two members of TG:Hack present an introduction to CTF, and the processes for creating and hosting a CTF. They give an insight into the process of creating tasks and the challenges with hosting and securing the infrastructure. In the end, a demonstration of how to solve a typical CTF task is performed.
