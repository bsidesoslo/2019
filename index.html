 <h1>The BSidesOslo Team</h1>

 <p>The BSidesOslo team are members of the local infosec community who felt the need for an accessible, inclusive event that is focused on learning and sharing. The BSides framework is a perfect fit. While individual BSides events have a focus on serving and representing their local communities, adopting this framework also ties us to an international network of diverse, independent events that seek to create opportunities to advance the infosec conversation beyond the mainstream.</p>

 <p>The team consists of:</p>
