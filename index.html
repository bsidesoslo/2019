     <h1>About</h1>
    <p>We're a Norwegian non-profit in the early stages of planning BSides Oslo 2019, and excited that we're already receiving interest and questions. BSides is about being good to the community so we want to share the details we have so far, even if they are not finalized yet. We also want to let you know who's behind this and how you get in touch if you have questions or would like to help out.</p>

    <p>We're working with the support of the kind and experienced folks at <a href="http://www.securitybsides.org">securitybsides.org</a> to bring a new kind of infosec event to Oslo. The plan is to start with a 1-day, 1-track event with the hope of expanding in the future. The date will be <b>May 23rd, 2019</b>, the Thursday following Paranoia 2019. This is in keeping with the common BSides approach of being adjacent to larger, commercial infosec events. We're currently making the final touches to our budget and hoping to announce the venue shortly. We've also launched our <a href="#CFP">call for presenters (CFP)</a> which will be open until March 8th, 2019, and about to officially start <a href="#sponsorship">fundraising.</a></p>

 <h1>The BSidesOslo Team</h1>

 <p>The BSidesOslo team are members of the local infosec community who felt the need for an accessible, inclusive event that is focused on learning and sharing. The BSides framework is a perfect fit. While individual BSides events have a focus on serving and representing their local communities, adopting this framework also ties us to an international network of diverse, independent events that seek to create opportunities to advance the infosec conversation beyond the mainstream.</p>

 <p>The team consists of:</p>
 <ul>
 	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo">Patricia Aas</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/nechered">Nelson Cheuque</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.meetup.com/OsloSec/members/192708169/">Ryan Mattinson</a></li>
