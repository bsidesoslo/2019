# BSides Oslo 2019

October 13, 2018

Hello Oslo!

We're still in the early stages of planning, but excited that we're already receiving interest and questions. BSides is about being good to the community so we want to share the details we have so far, even if they are not finalized yet. We also want to let you know who's behind this and how you get in touch if you have questions or would like to help out.

The BSidesOslo team are members of the local infosec community who felt the need for an accessible, inclusive event that is focused on learning and sharing. The BSides framework was a perfect fit for this niche. Although individual BSides events have a focus on serving and representing their local communities, adopting this framework also ties us to an international network of diverse, independent events that seek to create opportunities to advance the infosec conversation beyond the mainstream.

The details so farâ€”we're a Norwegian non-profit working with the support of the kind and experienced folks at <a href="http://www.securitybsides.org">securitybsides.org</a> to bring a new kind of infosec event to Oslo. The plan is to start with a 1-day, 1-track event with the hope of expanding in the future. The date will be May 23rd, 2019, the Thursday following Paranoia 2019. This is in keeping with the common BSides approach of being adjacent to larger, commercial infosec events. The next important detail is to finalize our budget and venue which we hope to announce shortly. Once that's taken care of we can work on our call for papers (CFP) and officially start fundraising.

In the meantime, please drop us a note at info(at)bsidesoslo.no if you have questions or would like to offer your support. If you would like to be informed when we launch our CFP, please express your interest to cfp(at)bsidesoslo.no. You can also follow us on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/oslobsides">@oslobsides</a> for updates.
